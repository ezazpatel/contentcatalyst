query Parameters
campaign-value	
string <= 200 characters
Affiliate partners only: Specifies the campaign tracking identifier that will be appended to the URL returned in productUrl as a query parameter. Campaigns allow you to track how specific links perform, with metrics such as sessions, bookings, and commission. Reports are available via the Viator Partner Platform.

Note: If you wish to use a campaign value that includes non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., '+', '-', etc.), you must URL-encode these characters.

target-lander	
string
Affiliate partners only: Specifies the type of landing page customers will be shown when opening the link provided in the productUrl field.

Ordinarily, when customers follow the link in productUrl, they are redirected to a sales-conversion-optimized affiliate landing page. This default behavior can be disabled by setting this parameter to "NONE", which will modify the productUrl query string such that when opened, the customer will instead land on the standard viator.com product display page, which is not optimized for affiliate-link sales.

Available values:

"NONE": Causes target_lander=NONE to be included in the productUrl query string, which will disable redirection to an affiliate landing page when the link is followed.
Our recommendation is for you to allow the default behavior by not including this parameter, unless you have a specific technical or business requirement to do so.
